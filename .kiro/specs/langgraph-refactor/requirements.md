# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to refactor the current LangGraph implementation to improve modularity, reusability, and robustness while integrating WebSocket support for real-time communication. The current implementation has several architectural issues including a monolithic structure, lack of proper error handling, and missing validation. This refactoring will address these issues while enhancing the system with WebSocket capabilities and maintaining compatibility with the existing API.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Modular LangGraph Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the LangGraph nodes to be modularized into separate components, so that I can easily maintain, extend, and reuse them.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer needs to modify a specific node's functionality THEN they SHALL be able to do so without affecting other nodes
2. WHEN a new node type is needed THEN the system SHALL allow adding it without modifying existing node implementations
3. WHEN the system is initialized THEN each node SHALL be loaded as a separate module
4. WHEN a node is instantiated THEN it SHALL follow a consistent interface pattern
5. WHEN a graph is constructed THEN it SHALL use the modular nodes through a factory pattern

### Requirement 2: WebSocket-Based Chat Server Implementation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to communicate with AI teachers in real-time through WebSockets, so that I can have responsive, bi-directional conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user connects to the WebSocket endpoint THEN the system SHALL authenticate the connection
2. WHEN a WebSocket connection is established THEN the system SHALL route messages based on user_id and teacher_id
3. WHEN a message is sent through WebSocket THEN the system SHALL process it asynchronously
4. WHEN multiple users are connected THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent connections efficiently
5. WHEN a WebSocket connection is lost THEN the system SHALL handle reconnection gracefully

### Requirement 3: RAG Integration with Chat Service

**User Story:** As a user, I want my conversations with AI teachers to be enhanced with relevant contextual information through RAG, so that I receive more accurate and informative responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a chat message is processed THEN the system SHALL determine if RAG enhancement is needed
2. WHEN RAG is enabled THEN the system SHALL retrieve relevant context from the knowledge base
3. WHEN context is retrieved THEN the system SHALL inject it into the conversation flow
4. WHEN RAG parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL use them to customize retrieval
5. WHEN RAG fails THEN the system SHALL continue with a fallback strategy

### Requirement 4: Robust Error Handling and Fallbacks

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the LangGraph implementation to handle errors gracefully and provide fallback mechanisms, so that the system remains operational even when components fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a retrieval operation fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with a fallback generation strategy
2. WHEN an LLM call fails THEN the system SHALL retry the operation with configurable retry parameters
3. WHEN all retries are exhausted THEN the system SHALL return a graceful error message to the user
4. WHEN a node encounters an error THEN it SHALL provide detailed error information for debugging
5. WHEN a critical error occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain the chat session state for recovery

### Requirement 5: Input/Output Validation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all inputs and outputs in the LangGraph nodes to be validated using Pydantic models, so that I can ensure data integrity and improve debugging.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data is passed between nodes THEN it SHALL be validated against a Pydantic model
2. WHEN invalid data is detected THEN the system SHALL raise appropriate validation errors
3. WHEN a node produces output THEN it SHALL conform to a predefined schema
4. WHEN API endpoints receive requests THEN they SHALL validate teacher_id and other parameters
5. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages indicating the validation issues

### Requirement 6: Redis TTL and Scalability Implementation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want Redis to be used efficiently for session management and caching with appropriate TTL settings, so that the system is scalable and memory usage is optimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a chat session is created THEN its Redis entries SHALL have appropriate TTL values
2. WHEN a chat session is inactive for a configurable period THEN it SHALL be automatically expired
3. WHEN Redis pub/sub is used for message distribution THEN it SHALL support multiple server instances
4. WHEN the system is scaled horizontally THEN Redis SHALL maintain session consistency across instances
5. WHEN connection pools are used THEN they SHALL be configured for optimal performance

### Requirement 7: API Security and Performance Enhancements

**User Story:** As a security officer, I want the API and WebSocket endpoints to implement proper authentication and performance optimizations, so that the system is secure and performs well under load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API or WebSocket endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL validate authentication credentials
2. WHEN a request contains a teacher_id parameter THEN it SHALL be validated for proper format and existence
3. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL use Uvicorn + Gunicorn workers with WebSocket support
4. WHEN an unauthorized request is detected THEN the system SHALL return appropriate status codes
5. WHEN the system is under load THEN it SHALL maintain performance through efficient caching and connection pooling
